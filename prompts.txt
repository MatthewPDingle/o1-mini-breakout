Do a rigorous examination of the physics in the collisions with the blocks to make sure the ball is bouncing off blocks correctly.  If you find any issues fix them.  Then think of some ideas to improve gameplay and implement those as well.

Do another rigorous exploration of the ball bouncing physics, and this time focus not just on collisions between the ball and blocks, but also the ball and the sides of the screen.  I noticed that occasionally the ball will get stuck along a wall.  Once you've completed your analysis and have fixed any issues that you've uncovered, think of some more ways to improve gameplay and add those to the game as well.  I'll need the complete updated code at the end.

Release: breakout003.py

7.
Do another deep dive into the physics of the ball colliding with the paddle.  I like how you made it so the angle at which it bounces off depends on where on the paddle it collides.  But I feel like there's still room for improvement there.  Once you're done with that, have identified any desirable changes, and have implemented them, please brainstorm some new ways to enhance the gameplay even further.  Implement all your changes and present the final, complete program at the end.

I'd like a few changes made to improve the user experience.  One is volume control.  The volume is a bit too loud by default and I'd like to be able to change it.  Two is that every level starts instantly.  I'd like the user to have to trigger the start of each level.  Third is that I'd like the angle at which the ball bounces off the paddle to be continuous.  A collision near the left side should bounce it at more of an angle to the left, a collision on the right should bounce it at more of an angle to the right, and a collision in the center should bounce it straight up.  There should be an even gradient of angles that the ball bounces off at depending on where it hits the paddle.  Please implement these changes, any other ideas you have to enhance gameplay, and present the full updated source code at the end.

Please continue development of the following game.  First up, your job is to fix the volume control.  While it gets updated on screen, the actual volume does not change.  Please default the volume level to 10% as well.  Once you've implemented the changes, please give me the fully updated source code.

Note: Started new conversation after it again had trouble implementing a "press space to start" feature at the beginning of every level.

You're going to be tasked with improving the following breakout game.  Since the codebase is getting to a decent size, I'd like you to add comprehensive logging to print out data to the console.  I'd like to give these console logs to you when I see something go wrong to help you diagnose.

Thanks for the detailed logging.  Instead of printing "Updating ball position" and "handling collisions", it might be more useful to log the angle at which the ball is travelling when it makes an impact and the angle at which it bounces off.  It also might be useful to log at what position on the paddle the ball bounces off.

14.
Please make some changes to the logging:

- Remove messages "Updating Paddle position"
- Remove messages "Paddle moving left/right"
- Remove messages "Ball angle before movement..."

15.
Some more logging changes please:

- Remove "Drawing text" messages
- Remove "Creating Brick" messages

16.
A few more debug changes.

- Remove messages "Paddle hit the left/right boundary"
- Remove messages "PowerUp 'multi_ball' moved to..."

17.
A couple more:

- Remove messages "PowerUp 'expanded_paddle' moved..."
- Remove messages "Paddle expansion timer"

18.
- Remove logging messages about "PowerUp 'expanded_paddle'..."
- Remove logging messages about "PowerUp 'extra_life'..."

19.
Remove all logging messages about PowerUps moving

You are going to be continuing development of the following breakout game.  Your first task is to analyze the logging from my play-through of level 1 and into level 2.  Identify any problems related to game mechanics or physics and implement fixes.  At the end please produce fully updated source code.

You are going to be continuing the development of this Breakout game.  Please analyze the source code to familiarize yourself with it.  I would each level to start out paused and the player has to hit space to start the level.  Add a message telling the player "Hit space to start" at the beginning of each level.  Hitting p to pause/unpause behavior should remain functional as well.  The game-flow should proceed as follows:

- Load level n but don't start it (paused).  Display message "Press space to start"
- Player hits space to start
- Player plays through and clears level n
- Load level n+1 but don't start it (paused).  Display message "Press space to start"
- Player hits space to start
- Player plays through and clears level n+1
- Repeat for all levels.

Do a deep dive into how to implement this functionality in an elegant way, and once you're done please produce the fully updated source code.

You are going to be continuing development of this breakout game.  Please do a deep-dive into the explosive blocks.  It seems (but maybe something else is going on) that the ball sometimes radically changes position after exploding a block.  The ball should be bouncing off these explosive blocks as normal.  I'd also like you to try and spice up the explosive blocks with fancier graphics/animations and sounds.  Keep in mind I have no external assets available to work with so everything has to stay native to python.  Produce fully updated source code when you're finished.

You are going to be continuing the development of the following Breakout game.  There's one minor issue I'd like you to fix - when a new level starts I notice that any falling power ups from the last level aren't removed.  Really dig into that functionality and see how you might go about fixing it.  Also I'd like you to use your creativity to think of ways to enhance the gameplay experience for the player.  Keep in mind I don't have access to any external audio or video assets so anything like that will have to be kept native to python.  Walk through your development approach, and when you're done, please give me the fully updated source code.

28.
Thank you.  When I cleared level 1, the level did not finish and it did not take me to level 2.  It got stuck in some kind of loop.  Here are the relevant logs from when it happened:

Brilliant!  I'm not always sure what type of power up I'm getting when I get one - can you add a brief message that quickly fades out that tells the player what type of power up they just got?

You are going to be continuing development of the following Breakout game.  

First, a couple tasks for you to work on:

A. The power up text often overlaps if I get several in sequence.  Can you have those text messages quickly move down as well as fade so they don't overlap if I get several all at once or in quick succession? 
B. I'm noticing some of the power-ups not getting applied perhaps?  Really dig into the logic and see if there's something as issue there. 

Dig into the details of how you'd approach figuring out and solving these two issues.  When you're finished, please return the complete updated source code.

You are going to be continuing development of the following Breakout game.  I have a few tasks to get you started:

A. I get repeated log messages about Shrinking Paddle.  For one, I don't need to see this particular message, but seeing it repeat over and over again in the logs suggests something might not be working right regarding the powerups.
B. The powerup messages should be displayed a bit lower on the screen.
C. Any time the player gets a power-up, it replaces any currently active power-up.  Power-ups like additional lives that aren't "active" and are simply one-off events can be ignored for this.
D. See if there's anything you can do to prevent power up messages from overlapping.  Right now they scroll up, but if I get several in quick succession the messages still overlap.  Maybe if one is still being displayed in the area where a new should appear, the older ones should be shifted up?

So put on your dev hat while digging into the code and implementing these changes.  When you're done, please produce fully updated source code.

A. The Slowed-Ball power up does not actually slow the ball down.
B. Can you move the power up messages a bit further down the screen?
C. Any active powerups should be removed at the start of a new level.
D. Have the power up messages scroll down instead of up.
E. Shrunk paddle power ups should only have a transient effect, similar to Large paddle power ups.
F. You cannot have 2 active powerups at the same time (for instance shrunk paddle and laser paddle).  Any new powerup the player gets takes the place of the previous active one.
