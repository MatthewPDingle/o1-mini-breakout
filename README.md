## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pygame library
- NumPy library

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/breakout-game.git
    cd breakout-game
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

## How to Play

### Objective
Break all the bricks in each level by bouncing the ball off the paddle without letting it fall off the bottom of the screen. Advance through all levels to win the game.

### Controls
- **Left Arrow Key**: Move the paddle left.
- **Right Arrow Key**: Move the paddle right.
- **Space Bar**: 
  - Start the level.
  - Shoot lasers (if the laser paddle power-up is active).
- **P Key**: Pause and resume the game.
- **Up Arrow Key**: Increase the game volume.
- **Down Arrow Key**: Decrease the game volume.
- **R Key**: Restart the game (when game over).
- **Q Key**: Quit the game (when game over).

### Gameplay Mechanics
- **Lives**: Start with 3 lives. You lose a life when all balls fall off the bottom of the screen.
- **Score**: Earn points by breaking bricks and catching power-ups.
- **Bricks**: Some bricks may require multiple hits to break and may be explosive.
- **Power-Ups**: Occasionally, breaking a brick will release a power-up. Catch it with the paddle to activate it.
- **Explosive Bricks**: Explosive bricks can destroy adjacent bricks upon destruction.

### Power-Ups Explained
- **Expand Paddle**: Increases the paddle's width, making it easier to hit the ball.
- **Extra Life**: Grants you an additional life.
- **Multi-Ball**: Splits the current ball into multiple balls, increasing your chances to break bricks but also increasing the challenge.
- **Shrink Paddle**: Decreases the paddle's width, making it more challenging to hit the ball.
- **Slow Ball**: Slows down the ball, giving you more time to react.
- **Laser Paddle**: Allows your paddle to shoot lasers using the Space Bar, destroying any bricks in their path.

### Tips
- Use the walls to your advantage to angle the ball towards hard-to-reach bricks.
- Catch power-ups whenever possible, but be cautious of negative ones like Shrink Paddle.
- Keep an eye on the number of balls in play during the Multi-Ball power-up to avoid losing them all.
- Adjust the volume to your liking using the Up and Down arrow keys.
